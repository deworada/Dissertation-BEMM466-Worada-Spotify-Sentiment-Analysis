## SQL Files

Ensure you have a copy of your DDL files saved here.  
All changes to the database must be recorded as different commits.  You must not have multiple files showing the same tables.
e.g. you are expected to use GitHub for version control.  After your initial commit from creating your database items, any changes after that should show the file being edited and then committed to the repo.
